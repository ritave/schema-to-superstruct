# schema-to-superstruct
Generate Typescript superstruct code based on JSON Schema

## This project is unfinished and not actively worked on
JSON schemas are based on intersection of rules, rather then composition. That paradigm is not easily convertable to an object oriented paradigm of superstruct.
In generall, it's easier to simply manually craft structs.
